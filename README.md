## Hi there 👋

My name is Michael Joseph Spano, and I am an Information Technology Managment student interested in **Python**, **SQ**L, and **Java**.

- 🔨 I built a program to take **Stock Market data** and export it to CSV, generate line charts with **Matplotlib**, gather company information, and give investment reccomendations, check it out [here](https://github.com/misb1280/stockmarkettool)!

## Hi there 👋

My name is Michael Joseph Spano, and I am an Information Technology Managment student interested in **Python**, **SQ**L, and **Java**.

- 🔨 I built a Python program called SMAI. SMAI takes **Stock Market data** and exports it to CSV, generates line charts with **Matplotlib**, gathers company information, and gives investment reccomendations, check it out [here](https://github.com/misb1280/stockmarkettool)!
